<h1>Game-Website</h1>
<p>This is a fun little website I put together to learn Node JS. In this I created many difference features.</p>

<h2> Webpages / Features</h2>
<h3> Chat Room</h3>
<p>I used a SQL database to store and share the messages in the chat room. Users can set a name that shows next to there message</p>

<h3> Paino </h3>
<p>Using java script I made a little piano that plays piano keys when pressed.</p>

<h3> Connect 4 </h3>
<p>I replicated the popular game connect 4. This uses sockets in Node Js to connect users to eachother.</p>


<h3> Soundboard </h3>
<p>This was a fun little page designed for friends to play loud noises into my headphones. It connects a python program on my computer
to the node js server. When the users click the play sound buttons it will play sounds on my computer using the python program</p>
<p> Note: This is a old project and I have lost the python part of this </p>

<h3> Battleship </h3>
<p>I replicated the popular game battleships this uses the socket connections once again used in the connect 4 game to connect the users to eachother </p>
<p> Note: This feature is currently not completed </p>

<h3> Snake </h3>
This is a replication of the popular old school snake game
<p> Note: This feature is currently not completed </p>
