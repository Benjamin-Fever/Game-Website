# Game-Website
This is a fun little website I put together to learn Node JS. In this I created many difference features.

## Webpages / Features
#### Chat Room
I used a SQL database to store and share the messages in the chat room. Users can set a name that shows next to there message

#### Paino
Using java script I made a little piano that plays piano keys when pressed.

#### 2048
I replicated the popular game 2048 in javascript for my website and paired it along side a SQL database to store.

#### Connect 4
I replicated the popular game connect 4. This uses sockets in Node Js to connect users to eachother.

#### Soundboard
This was a fun little page designed for friends to play loud noises into my headphones. It connects a python program on my computer
to the node js server. When the users click the play sound buttons it will play sounds on my computer using the python program
###### Note: This is a old project and I have lost the python part of this

#### Battleship
I replicated the popular game battleships this uses the socket connections once again used in the connect 4 game to connect the users to eachother
###### Note: This feature is currently not completed

#### Snake
This is a replication of the popular old school snake game. This is currenly uncompleted.
